    <h1>Australian Catering Industry Insights Dashboard</h1>
    <p>A comprehensive view of Australia’s restaurant and catering ecosystem — from city distribution and cuisine growth to cost structure and supply networks.</p>
  </header>

  <main>

    <!-- 1️⃣ Restaurant by City -->
    <section>
      <h2>Restaurant Density by City</h2>
      <p class="caption">A comparison of restaurant concentration across Australian cities — showing where the country’s culinary diversity and business opportunities thrive.</p>
      <div id="vis1" class="vis"></div>
      <p class="subcaption">Sydney and Melbourne continue to dominate Australia’s culinary landscape, both in restaurant density and revenue per venue, driven by population size, tourism, and diverse immigrant influences. Brisbane and Perth are emerging as strong contenders, supported by expanding urban populations and evolving local dining cultures that emphasise casual, community-focused experiences. Meanwhile, Adelaide and Hobart maintain smaller but stable markets characterised by high-quality boutique establishments that focus on sustainability and regional produce.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2️⃣ Cuisine Revenue -->
    <section>
      <h2>Cuisine Revenue Trends (2000–2025)</h2>
      <p class="caption">Longitudinal revenue data revealing how Australians’ culinary preferences have evolved — from traditional European cuisines to Asian fusion and plant-based trends.</p>
      <div id="vis2" class="vis" style="height:1800px;"></div>
      <p class="subcaption">Over the past two decades, the revenue landscape of Australian cuisine has shifted dramatically, reflecting broader cultural and economic trends. Traditional European cuisines such as Italian and French have plateaued, while Asian fusion, vegan, and health-oriented menus have surged in popularity since 2015. The rise of food delivery platforms further diversified revenue streams, allowing niche operators to reach broader audiences. Despite setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, innovation in takeaway models and cloud kitchens helped accelerate recovery and reshape the post-pandemic dining economy.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3️⃣ Australia Catering Revenue -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overall Catering Revenue Outlook</h2>
      <p class="caption">This visual aggregates national catering revenue performance to highlight macro-economic health, recovery patterns, and long-term business sustainability.</p>
      <div id="vis3" class="vis" style="height:1500px;"></div>
      <p class="subcaption">The catering industry’s revenue trajectory showcases both volatility and adaptability. Seasonal peaks during holidays and large events indicate strong dependence on consumer celebrations and corporate gatherings. However, the sector’s quick rebound after the pandemic highlights structural resilience and improved crisis management. The growing influence of online ordering, digital invoicing, and subscription-based meal planning has allowed catering businesses to maintain stability even in fluctuating demand periods. This consistent recovery suggests growing confidence among both consumers and service providers in Australia’s food industry.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4️⃣ Catering Market Size -->
    <section>
      <h2>National Catering Market Size Growth</h2>
      <p class="caption">Illustrates the total market value of Australia’s catering sector over time, capturing shifts in consumer demand, event culture, and service innovation.</p>
      <div id="vis4" class="vis"></div>
      <p class="subcaption">The overall market size of Australia’s catering sector reflects a clear upward momentum, fuelled by economic recovery, innovation, and changing social habits. Demand for high-quality, event-based catering is complemented by growth in personalised and health-conscious menus tailored to corporate wellness and family gatherings. The data suggest that technological improvements — such as inventory automation and AI-driven logistics — have reduced waste and increased profit margins. Forecast models predict continued expansion through 2025, driven by sustainable practices and increasing international interest in Australian cuisine exports.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5️⃣ Restaurant Cost Allocation -->
    <section>
      <h2>Restaurant Cost Allocation</h2>
      <p class="caption">This visualisation breaks down how an average Australian restaurant allocates its expenses — offering insights into which operational factors impact profitability the most.</p>
      <div id="vis5" class="vis"></div>
      <p class="subcaption">Operating a restaurant in Australia involves complex cost structures that directly impact profit margins and long-term survival. Labour and ingredients consistently make up the bulk of expenses, often exceeding 60% of total costs. Rising rent and energy prices add significant fixed burdens, especially in urban centres. However, efficient logistics, digital ordering, and inventory management tools have started to offset these expenses. The balance between cost control and maintaining quality continues to define competitive advantage, especially for small and mid-sized independent operators facing tightening economic pressures.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6️⃣ Supply Chain Map -->
    <section>
      <h2>Australia’s Food Supply Chain</h2>
      <p class="caption">Mapping the origins of catering ingredients across Australia and abroad — revealing the country’s dependence on both local producers and international trade routes.</p>
      <div id="vis6" class="vis"></div>
      <p class="subcaption">The supply chain underpinning Australia’s catering and restaurant industry reveals a sophisticated mix of local resilience and global interdependence. Domestic farms supply the majority of fresh produce, dairy, and meats, while imported goods — such as spices, wine, and seafood — fill niche demands and seasonal gaps. The reliance on international trade exposes the industry to exchange rate volatility and shipping disruptions, as seen during the pandemic. Yet, emerging sustainability initiatives and regional sourcing programs are helping reduce carbon footprints and strengthen local producer relationships across Australia’s vast geography.</p>
